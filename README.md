# My Python Learning Journey 🐍

Hey there! This is my collection of Python practice codes from when I was learning the basics around Diwali 2025.

## About This Repo

So basically, I learned Python from **Apna College's** YouTube course during my Diwali break. These are all the small codes and practice problems I did while following along. Nothing fancy, just pure beginner stuff, but it helped me understand the concepts properly.

I've kept most of the code as comments in one file because that's how I practiced - just commenting out the previous code and moving to the next topic. It's a bit messy but it shows the real learning process lol.

## What's Covered

The code covers pretty much all the Python basics:
- **Basic Operations** - arithmetic, input/output, data types
- **Strings** - slicing, methods, manipulation  
- **Conditionals** - if-else statements, comparisons
- **Lists & Tuples** - arrays, indexing, methods
- **Dictionaries & Sets** - key-value pairs, set operations
- **Loops** - while loops, for loops, range()
- **Functions** - defining functions, recursion
- **File I/O** - reading and writing files
- **OOP Basics** - classes, objects, inheritance
- **Mini Projects** - small fun projects like number guessing game, password generator

## NOW IM LEARNING ABOUT LIBRARIES  OF PYTHON SO ILL UPDATE IT EVERYTIME I DO ONE
- **added Numpy** - slicing ,arithmetic ,broadcasting, aggregate functions, filtering 
-**added Pandas** -

## My Thoughts on the Course

Honestly, if you don't know anything about Python, Apna College's course is pretty solid. It's in Hindi/English mix which makes it easier to understand, and they explain things in a simple way. Perfect for absolute beginners like I was.

The course doesn't go super deep into advanced stuff, but it gives you a strong foundation to build on. After this, you can easily move to more complex topics.

## How to Use This

Just open the main file and uncomment whatever topic you want to run. Each section is labeled so you can find what you're looking for.

Feel free to use this if you're learning Python too! We all start somewhere 😄
